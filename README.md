Welcome to the RetortJS playground. Bookmark this URL to come back and play with RetortJS anytime. 

You'll need your OpenAI API key to get started. If you don't have one, [you can get one here](https://platform.openai.com/signup). Once entered, you'll be able to run and modify the script template and see the output of each message in the conversation.

Use the `retort` directory to store your scripts. This will be the root directory for all your retort scripts and will make them available in the playground.
